                    <h4>MY STORY (SO FAR)</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>My interests were initially in the area of "Design". I actually never liked coding or programming to start with. After I graduated from College, I started an intenship and I was assigned to the Dev team. I started as a UI designer and later ventured deeper into UI/UX and eventually obtained certification as a UX designer. Like I said, I thought design was all there was, but I decided to give front-end development a chance. I even learned more Javascript than I would've wanted to and started getting ready to learn a front-end framework. I was getting really comfortable with it and I was making notable progress... Well, to my biggest surprise, I was sent to the Backend team. This demanded that I learned Backend engineering concepts and a backend framework and as wonderful as you'd guess, Django was my choice.</p>
                    <p>I started learning "the same Python wey bite me for School dah year" and I built a few things and it made me proud. I was encouraged and kept pushing.</p>
                    <p>I won't say I've come a long way even if I have; but there's still so much more I'm going to do and I look forward to exploring different technologies and building whatever I can to help solve problems and contribute to the tech-space.</p>

					<hr>
					<p>I'm currently a Developer at Ethnos cyber ltd.</p>
					<p>I've designed and built a few things over the years. I've also collaborated with people on some projects; but since I became serious about coding, I am yet to work on very large scale projects on my own. I've built some applications on my own using Django and soon enough, I'll start building APIs.</p>

                    <h5>How I learn</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>If I'm to put it in the most simple phrase, "Just do it". Good one right? I know, shout out to Nike.</p>
                    <p>In reality I just build and keep building even if it doesn't seem like it'll work. I still carry on.</p>

					<hr>
					<p>Python, Django, HTML/CSS, JavaScript/Typescript, React, Postgres, AWS and APIs such as google maps, and a whole bunch more I canâ€™t possibly mention in one sentence!</p>
					<p>PS: Working on some Django projects, learning React on the side. Might be getting into NextJs soon.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>The thing I have now that my past self didn't was Courage. Throughout my journey, it's become so much clearer how failing here and there; your code not running and everything crashing - is an opportunity to learn and understand something new.</p>
                    <p>I'm resillient and I refuse to give up. I always look for ways to level up and seek the most efficient way of achieving any task. That is how I learn.</p>
